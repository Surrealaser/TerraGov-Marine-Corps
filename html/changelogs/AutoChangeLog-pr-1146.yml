changes: 
  - tweak: "RNG on grab breaking removed; now whenever you resist, you increment your grab resist level by 1 until it exceeds the level of a grab, thereby breaking it."
  - tweak: "Hunters gain armor penetration on stationary/stalk sneak attacks: 20% while on harm intent, and 50% while on disarm intent."
  - tweak: "Stagger, slowdown stacks decreased by 33% for running sneak attacks. Stagger and slowdown stacks increased by 33% for stationary/stalk sneak attacks. Knockout stacks reduced by 50% for running sneak attacks."
  - tweak: "Hunter sneak attack multiplier now declines by 0.2 per tile moved while running to a minimum of 1.25x. This is recovered at a rate of +1 per tick while stationary/destealthed, or per tile moved while walking/stalking."
